#There are two ways to merge one branch into other
#First is to generate a Pull request, it helps to review the code by fellow developers before committing to the master branch
git push origin feature_branch
# Second is to directly merge a branch, for this you have to switch to the branch which you are interested to commit
git checkout master
git merge feature_branch
